# Streamlit Workshop at KAUST

Before attending the workshop, please complete the following preparations:

### 1. Install Anaconda
We will use the Anaconda prompt to create a new environment with the necessary libraries, avoiding conflicts with other dependencies. After downloading Anaconda, follow these steps:

- Open the Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment:
  
`conda create --name streamlitEnv python=3.10.13`

This command creates a new environment named "streamlitEnv" with Python version 3.10.13.

- Activate the environment:
  
`conda activate streamlitEnv`

- Install the necessary libraries (ensure you have the 'requirements.txt' file downloaded):
  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now, your environment is set up and ready for the workshop.

### 2. OpenAI API Keys
During the workshop, OpenAI API Keys will be distributed to attendees for use in the project we'll be building together. These keys will be terminated at the end of the workshop. Please keep your API key confidential.

### 3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Ensure you have an IDE installed. I personally recommend using Visual Studio, but you may use your preferred IDE.

Enjoy the workshop and happy coding!
